<h2>Other sites I like</h2>

<p>It can be hard to find treasure in the junkyard known as the Internet, so I will catalogue the ones I've encountered here:</p>

<h3>Alternative theories</h3>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://www.debunkingskeptics.com/">Debunking Skeptics</a> - Probably my favorite site on the Internet (except my own, of course ^_^). I was reading it religiously as a teenager, and it provided strong support towards my questioning of mainstream theories and their devout defenders; <strong>without that site, there would likely be no Dig Deeper</strong>. If you liked my <a href="./articles/mozilla.xhtml">Mozilla</a> or <a href="./articles/corona.xhtml">Coronavirus</a> reports, you will feel right at home on <em>Debunking Skeptics</em>. Covers many fringe topics, such as <a href="https://www.debunkingskeptics.com/Conspiracies.htm">conspiracies</a>, <a href="https://www.debunkingskeptics.com/Presentation_Skepticism_Psi.htm">extrasensory perception</a>, and life after death. Mostly famous for its <a href="https://www.debunkingskeptics.com/Contents.htm">total destruction</a> of the so-called "rational skeptics", pretty much making them look like total idiots. Sadly hasn't been updated in a long time, but all the reports in there are still very relevant today.</p>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://www.macroevolution.net/introduction.html">Eugene McCarthy</a> - Are humans the hybrids of chimpanzees and pigs? Finally, we have a scientific explanation for humanity's existence that fits the pieces extremely well together without all the pitfalls of mainstream theories. Take the pigpill!</p>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "http://mileswmathis.com">Miles Mathis</a> - This guy has some nice papers exposing staged / fake events (check out his <a href="http://milesmathis.com/hawk3.pdf">Stephen Hawking report</a>, for example - and prepare to have your mind blown to pieces), relying on photo analysis, genealogies, and general logic. He also covers many different topics, and has a kind of high-level understanding of the world that I think is rare; most articles have some kind of insight stuck in them. So I recommend keeping an eye on this guy.</p>

<h3>Nutrition</h3>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://raypeat.com">Ray Peat</a> - Writings of biologist Raymond Peat, mostly covering human physiology and nutrition, but drifting into other related topics (including relevant conspiracies) sometimes. Extremely well thought-out and researched; compared to regular nutrition sites, it's in another stratosphere. Articles also available at Chadnet, just in case his goes down after his departure.</p>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://vitamindwiki.com">Vitamin D Wiki</a> - An absolutely insane life project of a single guy (?). The amount of admiration I have for this site cannot be put in words. Everything you have ever wanted to know about Vitamin D - the most important nutrient for human biology - is here. And then ten times that, if you are still hungry :D. Beautifully presented and fully referenced, even includes a bunch of charts, graphs, etc for pretty much every relevant issue. Hey, Vit D Wiki even works without JavaScript at all. S tier site, a true gem.</p>

<h3>YouTube channels</h3>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://invidious.fdn.fr/channel/UCKOnM_lSgM8vlw9MTM2J7Hw">Verlisify</a> - YouTube channel mainly about Pokemon games. The most interesting part of it, though, is his constant expositions of the cheaters in the biggest Pokemon tournaments. He's proven that during the last decade, <a href="https://invidious.fdn.fr/watch?v=xQH-42fsSmc">many Pokemon world champions have been using hacked pokemon to win their titles</a>. He's also shown the complicity of tournament organizers, who <a href="https://invidious.fdn.fr/watch?v=ENo7BTrdGUk">protect the cheaters</a> that now seem to be running the show. You just have to admire Verlisify's dedication in pounding this for years and years in hopes that some really big fish at Nintendo / TPC takes notice. Even though I don't play Pokemon anymore and this doesn't really affect me, let me give an endorsement to the only person who's covering this issue properly, even while being hated and derided everywhere. This is really the modern Galileo situation.</p>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://invidious.fdn.fr/channel/UChAHYPBvyaQIpjyTSdQhOMQ">FalKKonE</a> - High quality video game remixes. Includes some of my favorite franchises like Pokemon, Ace Attorney, and Undertale.</p>

<h3>Services</h3>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://sci-hub.st">Sci-hub</a> - Just in case someone doesn't know about it, it allows you to read scientific papers without paying, subscribing, etc. It's piracy, but for non-entertainment purposes :D. Hey, without it, my corona report probably wouldn't exist. Don't feel bad about using it; governments / medical institutions are basing some decisions on the paid studies - and you have the right to know just how solid they are. To download a study, you usually just need its PMID number.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "http://ciphersbyritter.com">Ciphers by Ritter</a> - Best cryptography resource out there, by a mile. Explains the basics thoroughly and in a way that's easy to understand. Debunks myths and covers stuff that other sites don't dare to touch. Clearly, the author has a deep understanding of the topic.</p>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href="https://unixsheikh.com/">Unix Sheikh</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://sadgrl.online/">sadgrl</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://ar.al">Aral Balkan</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://sysdfree.wordpress.com">sysdfree</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="http://gpvdip7rd7bdy5gf7scl3rzgzgzckqw4sqxbmy6g3zijfwu4lz3ypbyd.onion/">Udonya</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://wrongthink.link/">Wrongthink</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://lemmy.ml/c/privatelife">TheAnonymouseJoker</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://koshka.love">Koshka</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://ijver.me/">ijver</a></p>

<h3>Others</h3>

<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://www.dragonflycave.com">The Cave of Dragonflies</a> - Look at the beautiful, old-school design! And the lovely style switcher! Imagine the effort, which has to be appreciated in the age of soydevism. Also, maintaining a Pokemon site for 20 (!) years is really impressive. Though it also has other useful content like HTML tutorials. And yet, the site hasn't managed to rack up even 10 million views during its entire existence. Sad.</p>
